I think it already should be the go-to software for free software projects and events.</p><p>PeerTube solves the disadvantages of centralized video control on the web in very innovative ways.</p><p>The project describes itself as:</p><blockquote><p>PeerTube is a free and open-source, decentralized, federated video platform powered by ActivityPub and WebTorrent, that uses peer-to-peer technology to reduce load on individual servers when viewing videos.</p></blockquote><p>In recent versions, they&rsquo;ve been working on real true P2P live streaming, and it&rsquo;s amazed me how far they&rsquo;ve gotten it so fast.</p><h2 id=its-not-a-youtube-killer-yet>It&rsquo;s not a YouTube killer&mldr; Yet.</h2><p>The software itself handles even demanding workloads great, stability has been surprisingly good. Even when we tried to really push the new live stream support.</p><p>Where things start to fall down for Jupiter Broadcasting is operating at scale, on an ongoing basis. Four or more shows a week, multiple team members, and live streams.</p><p><strong>Our key problems with PeerTube as is today:</strong></p><ul><li>Unclear on how to scale management across multiple channels/shows<ul><li>I need an account for every show, plus a network account for live streams, plus my personal account for comments and my own feed.</li><li>And each member of Jupiter Broadcasting would need an account.</li><li>It just becomes a lot to manage. And not super easy to automate. Which is a big deal to us.</li></ul></li><li>Live stream support is GREAT for v1 support. However it is still tricky to use, especially if you want to have a live stream auto-publish. If, for some reason, that stream drops at any point you are kind of locked out and have to regenerate an API key, which can break service integrations such as restream.io.</li><li>The disk space is ~30G and <em>growing</em>. - And that&rsquo;s with only two of our shows being test published for a few months.</li><li>There is no great way to mass-import. We want to bring our entire back-catalog online, but it would take a lifetime one video at a time.<ul><li>Some kind of directory import would be ideal. Import the videos and read title/description from a text file.</li><li>Or an RSS feed import</li><li>The current video import options are really nice, just need expanded for us.</li></ul></li></ul><h2 id=were-kind-of-a-big-deal->We&rsquo;re kind of a big deal&mldr; ;)</h2><p>I think some of these pain points are almost a non-issue for simpler use cases. The project that makes the one off video from time to time, or the community event that wants a full free stack to stream and make talks available. PeerTube can crush those jobs. For that kind of work, it really is a YouTube killer in a box.</p><p>But for content creators putting out a lot of content, across various &ldquo;channels&rdquo; it is tricky and cumbersome to manage.</p><p>The network effect is also an issue. Our viewers just started forgetting to use PeerTube, falling back into the habit of YouTube and TWiTCH instead. But I hope as more PeerTube instances pop up this issue starts to resolve itself faster than we typically see online. PeerTube&rsquo;s clever use of <a href=https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/>ActivityPub</a> means there is a decentralized way for viewers to get notified about new content. And it just takes a core group of viewers to get a video noticed and rolling.</p><p>For now, we plan to keep testing PeerTube behined the scenes, trying out the new releases, and searching for ways to automate deploying content to PeerTube.</p><p>We&rsquo;re taking our public instance offline since it won&rsquo;t be getting the focus it deserves, and does not represent how excited we are about PeerTube and our intent to go all in once everything is ready.</p><p>Check back here in the future, you never know when we might give it a go again.</p><h3 id=previous-peertube-coverage>Previous PeerTube coverage</h3><ul><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkmSD3Z0kUk&t=301s">Fedora to the Core | LINUX Unplugged 255</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZUDSdeBretw&t=4946s">Peering Into the Future | LINUX Unplugged 256</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/SE7NO3mbo9w?t=2666">GNOME, GNOME on the Range | LINUX Unplugged 261</a></p></li><li><p><a href="https://youtu.be/p3bEumYnnAo?t=2219">Waxing On With Wendell | LINUX Unplugged 388</a></p></li></ul><h3 id=feedback-and-corrections>Feedback and Corrections</h3><p><a href=https://linuxunplugged.com/contact>Our contact page</a></p><p>-Chris</p></div><div class=posts><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__buttons></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class="copyright copyright--user"><span>&copy Jupiter Broadcasting</span></div></div></footer><script src=https://jupiter.tube/assets/main.js></script><script src=https://jupiter.tube/assets/prism.js></script></div></body></html>
